## Kohana PHP Framework

Kohana is an elegant, open source, and object oriented HMVC framework built
using PHP5, by a team of volunteers. It aims to be swift, secure, and small.

Released under a BSD license, Kohana can be used legally for any open source,
commercial, or personal project.

This is a forked version of the final version of Kohana 2.3.4 made to work
under more recent versions of PHP than originally coded against.  Work is in
progress to make it work under PHP7...
